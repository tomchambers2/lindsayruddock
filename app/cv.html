<p>I made two major contributions as product support engineer for LUL Central Line, Singapore and Beijing metros block signaling systems. During early FS2000 support, a serious signal-processing problem became apparent which was preventing LUL Central Line contract from being concluded. I proposed a radical solution using latest technology 14 pole switched capacitor filters. I drew up a schedule to design, produce, test, document and install a new PCB on every Central Line train within the allowed target of four months. To achieve this and steer my design through production and installation, I worked closely with many Westinghouse teams. My PCB was the very first surface mount board to be manufactured in-house at Westinghouse. I assisted in setting up the line and am proud that all these activities resulted in a successful solution delivered within the scheduled timescale. This was a major benefit to the company.</p>

Also, my own product, between 1988 and 1993 I worked on my own product covering the full lifecycle of design, manufacture and worldwide marketing of a vario/altimeter for hang gliding. In a fiercely competitive market the LR3 became recognized internationally for performance and reliability.

The design of an alti/vario requires successful low power precision measurement of air pressure, low noise analog design especially 1/f noise, high stability electronics, precision temperature compensation, elimination of pA surface leakage, and highest emc immunity. Key circuits included an analog lineariser, low noise power supply, differentiator, A/Ds and LCD. I designed and manufactured the moulded plastic housing.
